# Booking_system
The Bus Reservation System is a comprehensive platform designed to streamline the process of bus seat booking and management. Users can easily register on the system by providing their full name, email, and password. Upon registration, users gain access to the system and can log in using their email and password. Authenticated users are empowered to book specific seats on buses, indicating the bus ID and their chosen seat number. The system provides efficient retrieval of booking information, allowing users to view their own bookings or access a comprehensive list of all bookings made in the system.
